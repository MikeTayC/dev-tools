# developer-tools
Magento module that contains developer tools

### Documentation
The Magento module has yet to be created. The *utilities* directory contains convenient script(s).

##### Utilities
1. *install-script-generator.php*: script that takes a csv file and generates an install script. Refer to this [google-doc](https://docs.google.com/a/blueacorn.com/spreadsheets/d/1QwDooHvtmwIXLMFcER9PeKrdV_DRWovvVoA9FOvfuwQ/edit?usp=sharing) for a starting point in creating the csv. The script can be used via the command ``php install-script-generator.php input_file.csv``. An optional second parameter will customize the name of the output file, which is *install-0.1.0.php* by default.

### Future Plans
Right now the only plans in the works are easy-to-use data script builders. Please submit issues with new ideas. The sky is the limit.

### Contributing
Any developer should feel free to contribute to this internal developer-tools module. To contribute, create your own feature branch and send an appropriate pull request to SamTay. If you have an idea but are too lazy to build it out yourself, submit an issue.
